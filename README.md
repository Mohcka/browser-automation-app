## Browser Automation App

This is a demonstration and my boilerplate on creating an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) desktop app to run the browser automater tool [Selenium-Webdriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/).  The webdriver will open a browser window and perform tasks as they were written, although opening a browser is not required, [as a headless option is a available](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48677891).

My current job requires a lot of data entry.  So I made this to help speed things up by packaging an app that my coworkers could open and use on their machines with user friendly UI.
